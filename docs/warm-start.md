# Warm starts and deduplication

A new git worktree normally starts with an empty build directory and compiles
every dependency from scratch, then keeps its own full copy of each. On a
filesystem with copy-on-write clones, cargo-steward avoids both:

- **`seed`** starts a new worktree's build directory as a clone of the best
  build among the repository's other worktrees: the main checkout's, or the
  most recently used other one when the main checkout has no build or a
  build is using it. The clone takes well under a second and no disk space,
  and cargo finds the dependencies already built.
- **`hooks`** installs a git hook that seeds each new worktree as git creates
  it. The [`cargo` proxy](proxy.md) seeds too, on a worktree's first build.
- **`dedup`** finds files that are byte-for-byte identical across build
  directories and makes them share one copy on disk.

Seeding and deduplication need a filesystem that can clone files: APFS on
macOS, or btrfs, XFS (formatted with reflink support, the default since
xfsprogs 5.1) or bcachefs on Linux. A build directory and the one it is
cloned from must be on the same volume. Elsewhere, they do nothing and say
so; they never fall back to copying bytes.

## `cargo steward seed`

```sh
cargo steward seed [--target-dir DIR] [--from DIR]... [--worktree DIR] [--quiet]
```

Clones another worktree's build directory into this worktree's, if this one
hasn't built anything yet, and prints which one it used:

```
Seeded /src/app-fix/target from /src/app-docs/target (worktree app-docs, last used 4m ago; busy: the main checkout; 0.31 s, copy-on-write)
```

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `--worktree DIR` | The current directory |
| `--target-dir DIR` | The worktree's target directory, as `cargo metadata` reports it there (so `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`, `build.target-dir` and `build.build-dir` are respected) |
| `--from DIR` | The best of the repository's other worktrees' build directories ([below](#which-build-it-clones)) |
| `-q`, `--quiet` | Print nothing |

`--from` can be given more than once. The first is used unless a build is
using it, then the most recently used of the others.

With `build.build-dir` set, the worktree's build directory (intermediate
artifacts) is seeded from another worktree's build directory, and its target
directory (final artifacts) from the same worktree's target directory.

### Which build it clones

The candidates are the build directories of the main checkout and of the
repository's other worktrees (`git worktree list`). Each is found without
running cargo there:

- A build directory inside the worktree (`target/`, or a relative
  `build.target-dir` or `build.build-dir`) is at the same place in every
  other worktree.
- Under the [`cargo` proxy](proxy.md), every worktree's target directory is
  in the repository's directory under `target-root`, including those of
  worktrees since deleted.
- Otherwise, the wrapper's records say which build directory each
  worktree's packages compiled into.

If none of these locates the main checkout's, `seed` runs `cargo metadata`
there.

The main checkout's build is used whenever it holds one and no build is
using it. Otherwise the others are tried from the most recently used (by the
wrapper's records, or the times cargo last wrote into each), skipping any
that hold no build or are on another volume. A candidate a build is using
gets half a second to come free before the next is tried; if builds are
using all of them, they're tried in turn until 5 seconds have passed, and
then the worktree builds cold.

It does nothing, and exits 0, when:

- `seed = false` is set in the settings;
- there's no cargo workspace at the worktree;
- the target already holds a build, or exists and isn't empty;
- no other worktree has a build to clone yet;
- the target and the source are the same directory (for example, a shared
  `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`);
- builds kept every candidate busy for 5 seconds;
- the filesystem can't clone, or the directories are on different volumes.

### What cargo rebuilds afterwards

Cargo decides what to rebuild by comparing file modification times, and a
clone keeps them. Dependencies from crates.io, git, or paths outside the
repository are found fresh. Crates inside the repository rebuild once,
because `git worktree add` writes their sources with new times. Incremental
caches come along, so those rebuilds are usually incremental.

### Safety

- The source is cloned while holding cargo's locks on each of its profiles,
  so it's never caught halfway through a build.
- The clone is made under a temporary name next to the target and renamed
  into place only while the target is still missing or empty, so a build
  never sees a half-made directory.
- A pin (`cargo steward pin`) on the source isn't copied to the clone.
- After the clone, the two directories are independent: building in one
  never changes the other.

## `cargo steward hooks`

```sh
cargo steward hooks install [--repo DIR]
cargo steward hooks uninstall [--repo DIR]
cargo steward hooks status [--repo DIR]
```

`--repo` defaults to the current directory. `install` writes a
`post-checkout` hook into the repository's hooks directory
(`core.hooksPath` if set, else `.git/hooks`), which all of its worktrees
share. When git creates a worktree, the hook runs:

```sh
cargo-steward seed --worktree "$PWD" --quiet
```

Plain checkouts and branch switches don't trigger it, and it never makes git
fail: if seeding can't run, git carries on.

The hook calls cargo-steward by the absolute path it was installed from. If
you move or reinstall the binary somewhere else, run `hooks install` again.

**An existing `post-checkout` hook is kept.** It's moved to
`post-checkout.pre-steward`, and the new hook runs it first with the same
arguments and exits with its status. `uninstall` removes the cargo-steward
hook and moves the original back, unchanged. If `core.hooksPath` points at a
directory you track in git, both commands change files there.

`status` reports whether the hook is installed, whether it chains another,
and whether seeding is turned off.

## Retiring a worktree

The `post-checkout` hook only seeds new worktrees. Before deleting one, run:

```sh
cargo steward remove --worktree ../app-fix-login --json
cargo steward remove --worktree ../app-fix-login --apply --json
git worktree remove ../app-fix-login
```

Review `skipped` before removing the checkout. Busy or pinned build output,
temporary directories with running programs or locked Cargo builds, and output
recorded for other worktrees are kept. Retry retirement after the work finishes;
the same command can remove its routed temporary files even if build output
was already deleted. Other worktrees' warm builds and shared compiler caches
stay in place.

If the build used an explicit target directory, pass it directly to `remove`.
If Git already removed the checkout, `remove --orphaned` previews known orphaned
build directories; add `--apply` to remove them. GC handles leftover routed
temporary files after `orphan-grace`. Interrupted `.steward-trash-*` deletions
appear in status and GC previews and require explicit `gc --apply` recovery.

## `cargo steward dedup`

```sh
cargo steward dedup               # report what would be shared
cargo steward dedup --apply [-v]  # share it; -v lists every file group
```

Looks through every build directory cargo-steward manages (those the
wrapper has recorded and those under `scan-roots`) for files that:

- are at least 64 KiB;
- are on the same volume;
- have the same name and size (cargo puts a hash of the unit's inputs in its
  output names, so identical outputs have identical names);
- have the same bytes, compared in full.

With `--apply`, each duplicate is replaced by a clone of one kept copy, with
the duplicate's own modification time and permissions, so cargo sees no
change. It then reports the change in the volume's free space, which is the
real measure: sizes as `du` counts them don't show shared blocks.

Things it leaves alone:

- Incremental caches (`incremental/`), which rustc treats as a unit.
- Files with more than one hard link. Dedup never creates hard links: cargo
  and rustc rewrite some outputs in place, which would change every linked
  copy.
- Files that are already clones of the kept copy. APFS can tell, so running
  `dedup` again finds nothing new to do; on Linux, a later run compares and
  clones the same files again.
- Any file in a profile a build is using, or that changed after it was
  compared. These are counted and left for the next run.

On macOS with `dedup = true` (the default), every applied cleanup (automatic
or `gc --apply`) also deduplicates, looking only at what changed since its
last pass: files created or replaced since then, and the files at the same
path in the other build directories, where the same unit's outputs are. Its
first pass, and `cargo steward dedup`, look at every file.
`cargo steward dedup` works whatever `dedup` is set to.
