name: cargo-steward
description: Use when building, cleaning or maintaining Rust/Cargo workspaces on a machine with cargo-steward; when disk space is low or build output (target/, build dirs, incremental caches, *.rcgu.o) needs cleaning; when creating or retiring git worktrees of a Rust repository; when a Rust build is cold, slow, or waiting for a build slot; or before running `cargo clean`, deleting target directories, or setting RUSTC_WRAPPER, CARGO_TARGET_DIR or --target-dir.

# Working with cargo-steward

cargo-steward runs every Rust compile here and keeps build output fast and
bounded. Work with it, not around it.

## Detect it

```sh
command -v cargo-steward && cargo steward doctor --json
```

It is active when the `wrapper` section has an `ok` check saying Cargo's
rustc-wrapper is cargo-steward. Otherwise follow the project's own rules.

## What it already does

- **Leak fix:** deletes the `*.rcgu.o` files each incremental rebuild
  replaces (Rust 1.88 to 1.100).
- **Background cleanup**, at most hourly: stale objects, old sessions, idle
  caches, build directories of deleted worktrees or unused for weeks, more
  when a disk runs low. It skips busy directories and running programs'.
- **Routing** (when `cargo` on PATH is the proxy): each worktree builds into
  its own directory under a central root, with its own TMPDIR.
- **Warm starts:** a new worktree's first build starts as a copy-on-write
  clone of the best build among the repository's checkouts (the main
  checkout's when no build holds it, else the most recently used).
- **Build slots:** at most `max-builds` cargo builds and `max-compiles`
  rustc processes run at once, machine-wide.
- **Memory admission:** optional `compile-memory-budget` reserves estimated
  memory with kernel-blocking waits. Through an inner cache wrapper only
  compilers the cache runs itself (executable links, for sccache) are
  measured; others use the fallback estimate. Reservations are not an RSS
  cap. Count and memory overrides are independent;
  `CARGO_STEWARD_MEMORY_BUDGET=0` disables memory admission.
- **Orphaned compiles:** when the process that started a compile exits
  first, such as a cargo killed alone, the wrapper ends that compile.
- **Costs:** `cargo steward stats --json` shows per-unit execution and queue
  time, plus CPU/RSS for direct compiler children. CI trim uses recent CPU
  cost per byte where observed, with LRU fallback and `--eviction lru`.

## Rules

1. **Never clean by hand.** No `cargo clean`, `rm -rf target`, or deleting
   `*.rcgu.o`, `incremental/` or `deps/`. Preview with `cargo steward gc`,
   then `cargo steward gc --apply`.
2. **Never set `RUSTC_WRAPPER`**; it bypasses cargo-steward. To run rustc
   through another wrapper, set `CARGO_STEWARD_INNER=<program>`.
3. **Target directory:** if `cargo steward shim explain --json` shows
   `target_dir.routed: true` and `proxy.active: true`, don't set
   `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` or `--target-dir`. Otherwise follow the project's
   policy.
4. **Create worktrees where the project's worktrees live** (its docs, or
   beside those in `git worktree list`). One outside the project tree misses
   its `.cargo/config.toml` and builds cold.
5. **Retire a worktree** you created before deleting it:

   ```sh
   cargo steward remove --worktree <dir> --json           # preview
   cargo steward remove --worktree <dir> --apply --json
   git worktree remove <dir>
   ```

   Check `skipped` before deleting the checkout. Retirement also removes its
   routed temporary files, including on a retry after build output is gone.
   It keeps running programs, locked temporary builds, pins, and recorded
   output belonging to other worktrees. The seeding hook does not retire worktrees.

   If you built it with your own `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`, pass that directory:
   `cargo steward remove <build-dir> --apply`. For worktrees already deleted:
   `cargo steward remove --orphaned [--apply]`. Never remove what another
   task or person owns.
6. **Pin what a long run depends on** (a benchmark baseline, a binary under
   test): `cargo steward pin <build-dir>`, then `unpin`.
7. **Report real numbers.** Sizes count like `du`, so clones count in every
   copy. Report space recovered from `freed_on_disk[].bytes` (`gc --apply
   --json` or `remove --apply --json`); report a directory's real cost as
   `unshared_bytes` (`status --sizes --json`).

## Machine output

`status`, `stats`, `gc`, `remove`, `dedup`, `doctor` and `shim explain` take `--json`:
one document on stdout, sizes in bytes. Failure prints
`{"version": 1, "error": "..."}` and exits nonzero.

- `doctor`: `sections[].checks[]` (`level`, `message`, `fix`).
- `status`: `build_dirs[]` (`path`, `last_used`, `pinned`, `orphaned`,
  `workspaces`, `size_bytes`, `unshared_bytes`), `disks[].free_bytes`, and
  `trash_dirs[]` (`path`, `owner_pid`, `owner_running`, optional sizes).
  Interrupted deletions are discoverable without a surviving build directory;
  preview with `gc`, then recover with explicit `gc --apply`.
- `stats`: `target_dir`, `units[]` (`path`, `observation` with calls,
  execution/queue/CPU milliseconds and direct-compiler peak RSS).
- `gc`, `remove`: `applied`, `actions[]` (`kind`, `path`, `bytes`),
  `skipped[].reason`, `total_bytes`, `freed_on_disk[]`; `remove` adds
  `worktrees[]` (`build_dir`, `exists`).
- `dedup`: `files`, `bytes`, `freed_on_disk_bytes`.
- `shim explain`: `target_dir` (`routed`, `path`, `free_bytes`), `seed`
  (`status`, `from`, `message`), `build_slot`, `proxy` (`active`: `cargo` on
  PATH is the proxy). Put `--json` before cargo arguments:
  `cargo steward shim explain --json -- test -p foo`.

**Before a large build**, check `target_dir.free_bytes` from `shim explain
--json` (unrouted: `df` the target directory). If low, run `gc --apply`.

## Waiting for a build slot

```
cargo-steward: waiting for one of 2 Cargo build slots (held by pid 4121: `cargo test` in /src/app)
```

All `max-builds` slots are taken by the builds named. Yours starts when one
frees: wait. Never kill other agents' builds or run the real cargo to skip
the line. If a holder is your own background build, finish or stop it.
`max-compiles` waits are silent: slower, not stuck.

## Commands

| Command | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `cargo steward doctor [--json]` | Check the setup |
| `cargo steward status [--discover] [--sizes] [--json]` | Recorded build directories and last observed compile; `--discover` also scans for unrecorded directories; `--sizes` measures disk use |
| `cargo steward stats [--target-dir DIR] [--json]` | Per-unit execution and queue time, direct-compiler CPU and peak RSS |
| `cargo steward gc [--apply] [-v] [--json]` | Preview, or run, a cleanup |
| `cargo steward remove (--worktree DIR \| BUILD_DIR... \| --orphaned) [--apply] [--json]` | Remove whole build directories safely |
| `cargo steward pin DIR` / `unpin DIR` | Protect a build directory from cleanup |
| `cargo steward dedup [--apply] [--json]` | Share identical files across build directories |
| `cargo steward seed --worktree DIR` | Start a worktree's build from another checkout's |
| `cargo steward shim explain [--json] [-- ARGS]` | Where a build here goes, seeding, free space |
| `cargo steward shim status` | Whether `cargo` on PATH is the proxy |

Change settings (`~/.cargo/steward/config.toml`) only when the user asks.

## Troubleshooting

- **Cold build in a new worktree:** run `cargo steward shim explain --json`
  there. `seed.status`: `will_seed` is good; `source_missing`: no other
  checkout has built yet; `all_busy`: builds hold every source, so seeding
  waits; `target_not_empty`: it already has output;
  `nothing_routed`: run `cargo steward seed --worktree <dir>` before the
  first build. Check rule 4.
- **Build fails mentioning cargo-steward:** rerun once. If it fails again,
  run `cargo steward doctor --json` and tell the user what it reports. Don't
  edit `~/.cargo/config.toml` or set `RUSTC_WRAPPER` to get past it.
- **Disk keeps filling:** find large idle directories in `cargo steward
  status --sizes --json`; ask before removing ones your task doesn't own.
